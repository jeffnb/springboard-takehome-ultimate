A simpler metric might be pickups and drop offs counts in the opposite city from the start location of the partner.  However, that metric would not give insight into the business value.  If the same drivers cross the bridge but it takes longer to start rides then it is of little value to the customer and has several downsides.  If the outcome is that riders are picked up more in a shorter time because more drivers are available then the toll could be offset by decreased ride abandonment."
